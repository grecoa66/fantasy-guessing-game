Hello Fanduel!

Thanks for the fun project! I really enjoyed making this game.

Tech I used:

- Create-react-app
- Styled-components
- React-testing-library
- React hooks
- VScode

Things I would have done with more time:

- Change some css to stablize the view when content is rendered. There is a lot of flutter when the player cards are rerendered.
- Test the gameController and gameContainer. I didn't want to spend 2 hours testing those components. They manage a decent amount of state and mocking everything would be a decent chunk of time.
